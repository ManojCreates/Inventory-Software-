**Inventory Management System**  
My first software project, this Python-based desktop application was designed to streamline inventory management for a glass, mirrors, and hardware shop. It features real-time stock updates, low inventory alerts, and an intuitive interface to simplify daily operations. Built using Tkinter (or PyQt), it combines functionality and user-friendliness, making inventory tracking and restocking seamless. This project marks the beginning of my journey in software development, showcasing my passion for solving real-world problems with technology.
